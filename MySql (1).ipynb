    "1. Database:\n",
    "   A database is a structured collection of data organized and stored in a way that allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and management of data. It is designed to provide a systematic approach to managing data, ensuring data integrity, and enabling efficient data manipulation and querying.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Databases consist of tables or collections that store data in a structured format. They are used to store and manage large amounts of data for various applications and purposes, such as websites, business systems, and scientific research.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. SQL Databases:\n",
    "   SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are traditional relational databases that use the SQL language to manage and manipulate data. They are based on the relational model and store data in tables with predefined schemas. SQL databases ensure data integrity through relationships, constraints, and transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Key characteristics of SQL databases include:\n",
    "   - Data is organized into tables with predefined columns and data types.\n",
    "   - Data is structured and follows a fixed schema.\n",
    "   - Tables have relationships defined through primary keys and foreign keys.\n",
    "   - SQL is used to query and manipulate data, including selecting, inserting, updating, and deleting records.\n",
    "   - Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, and Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "   NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases are a newer category of databases that offer flexible and schema-less data models. They are designed to handle unstructured, semi-structured, and rapidly changing data. NoSQL databases are often used for large-scale, distributed, and real-time applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Key characteristics of NoSQL databases include:\n",
    "   - Flexible and dynamic data models that allow for schema-less storage.\n",
    "   - Data can be stored in various formats like key-value pairs, documents, columnar, or graphs.\n",
    "   - Horizontal scalability, allowing for easy distribution of data across multiple servers or clusters.\n",
    "   - NoSQL databases provide high performance and scalability for handling large amounts of data and high traffic loads.\n",
    "   - Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, and Amazon DynamoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences between SQL and NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "1. Data Model: SQL databases use a fixed schema and predefined relationships, while NoSQL databases have a flexible and dynamic data model, allowing for schema-less storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Scalability: SQL databases are vertically scalable, meaning they can handle increased loads by increasing the hardware resources of a single server. NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable, allowing for distributed storage and handling of large amounts of data across multiple servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Query Language: SQL databases use the SQL language for data querying and manipulation. NoSQL databases use various query languages or APIs specific to their data model (e.g., MongoDB uses the MongoDB Query Language).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Data Structure: SQL databases store data in tables with rows and columns, following a fixed schema. NoSQL databases can use different data structures like key-value pairs, documents, column families, or graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Use Cases: SQL databases are well-suited for applications requiring structured and relational data, complex queries, and transactions. NoSQL databases are suitable for applications with rapidly changing data, high scalability requirements, and flexible data models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on factors such as the nature of the data, scalability needs, data complexity, and specific application requirements. Both types of databases have their strengths and are used in different contexts based on the specific use case and desired characteristics."

    "DDL stands for Data Definition Language, which is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language). DDL is used to define and manage the structure of a database, including creating, modifying, and deleting database objects such as tables, indexes, and constraints. DDL statements are used to define the schema and organization of the data in a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common DDL statements and their purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. CREATE:\n",
    "   The CREATE statement is used to create new database objects, such as tables, views, indexes, or stored procedures. It defines the structure and attributes of the object being created.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: Creating a table named \"Customers\" with columns for customer details:\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   CREATE TABLE Customers (\n",
    "       id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "       name VARCHAR(100),\n",
    "       email VARCHAR(100)\n",
    "   );\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. DROP:\n",
    "   The DROP statement is used to delete existing database objects, such as tables, views, or indexes. It removes the specified object and all associated data from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: Dropping a table named \"Customers\":\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   DROP TABLE Customers;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ALTER:\n",
    "   The ALTER statement is used to modify the structure of an existing database object. It allows you to add, modify, or delete columns, constraints, or other attributes of a table or view.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: Adding a new column named \"phone\" to the \"Customers\" table:\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   ALTER TABLE Customers\n",
    "   ADD COLUMN phone VARCHAR(20);\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. TRUNCATE:\n",
    "   The TRUNCATE statement is used to delete all rows from a table, while keeping the table structure intact. It removes all data in a table, but the table itself remains.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: Truncating the \"Customers\" table to delete all records:\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   TRUNCATE TABLE Customers;\n",

Unlike DDL (Data Definition Language), which focuses on defining and managing the structure of a database, DML statements are used to manipulate the data stored within the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common DML statements and their purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. INSERT:\n",
    "   The INSERT statement is used to insert new rows or records into a table. It allows you to specify the values to be inserted into each column of the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: Inserting a new customer into the \"Customers\" table:\n",

    "DQL stands for Data Query Language, which is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language). DQL is used to retrieve data from a database by executing SELECT statements. SELECT statements allow you to query and retrieve specific data from one or more tables in a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SELECT statement is the primary statement used for data retrieval in SQL. It allows you to specify the columns to be selected, the table(s) from which to retrieve data, and optional conditions for filtering the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of using the SELECT statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a table named \"Employees\" with columns \"id\", \"name\", \"age\", and \"salary\". To retrieve the names and salaries of all employees above a certain age:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT name, salary\n",
    "FROM Employees\n",
    "WHERE age > 30;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- `SELECT name, salary` specifies the columns to be retrieved: \"name\" and \"salary\".\n",
    "- `FROM Employees` specifies the table from which to retrieve the data: \"Employees\".\n",
    "- `WHERE age > 30` specifies the condition for filtering the data: only employees with an age greater than 30 will be included in the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of the SELECT statement will be a result set consisting of the selected columns and rows that satisfy the specified conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can further enhance the SELECT statement by using various clauses, such as:\n",
    "- `ORDER BY` to sort the result set based on a specific column.\n",
    "- `GROUP BY` to group the result set based on one or more columns.\n",
    "- `HAVING` to filter the grouped result set based on conditions.\n",
    "- `JOIN` to combine data from multiple tables based on specified relationships.\n",

    "Primary Key:\n",
    "A primary key is a column or set of columns in a database table that uniquely identifies each row. It serves as a unique identifier for each record in the table and ensures data integrity and uniqueness. The primary key constraint guarantees that the values in the primary key column(s) are unique and not null. It helps establish the entity integrity of the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key points about primary keys:\n",
    "- Primary keys must have unique values for each row in the table.\n",
    "- Primary keys cannot contain duplicate or null values.\n",
    "- Each table in a database can have only one primary key.\n",
    "- Primary keys can consist of a single column or a combination of multiple columns (composite key).\n",
    "- Primary keys are often used as the basis for defining relationships between tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider a table named \"Customers\" with columns \"customer_id\", \"name\", and \"email\". To set the \"customer_id\" column as the primary key:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE Customers (\n",
    "    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    name VARCHAR(100),\n",
    "    email VARCHAR(100)\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the \"customer_id\" column is designated as the primary key. It ensures that each value in the \"customer_id\" column is unique for every row in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Foreign Key:\n",
    "A foreign key is a column or set of columns in a database table that refers to the primary key of another table. It establishes a relationship between two tables, known as the parent table (referenced table) and the child table (referring table). The foreign key constraint ensures referential integrity by enforcing that values in the foreign key column(s) of the child table match the primary key values in the parent table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key points about foreign keys:\n",
    "- Foreign keys establish relationships between tables and maintain data integrity.\n",
    "- Foreign key values in the child table must match the primary key values in the parent table.\n",
    "- Foreign keys can be one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many relationships between tables.\n",
    "- Foreign keys can be used to enforce cascading updates and deletions when records in the parent table are modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider two tables, \"Orders\" and \"Customers\", where \"Orders\" has a foreign key column \"customer_id\" that references the primary key \"customer_id\" in the \"Customers\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE Customers (\n",
    "    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    name VARCHAR(100),\n",

    "CREATE TABLE Orders (\n",
    "    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    order_date DATE,\n",
    "    customer_id INT,\n",
    "    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES Customers(customer_id)\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the \"customer_id\" column in the \"Orders\" table is a foreign key that references the primary key \"customer_id\" in the \"Customers\" table. It establishes a relationship between the two tables, ensuring that the values in the \"customer_id\" column of the \"Orders\" table match the existing primary key values in the \"Customers\" table.\n",

    "pip install mysql-connector-python\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example Python code to connect to MySQL and execute a query using the `cursor()` and `execute()` methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import mysql.connector\n",
    "\n",
    "# Establish a connection to MySQL\n",
    "conn = mysql.connector.connect(\n",
    "    host=\"localhost\",\n",
    "    user=\"your_username\",\n",
    "    password=\"your_password\",\n",

    "# Close the cursor and connection\n",
    "cursor.close()\n",
    "conn.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "1. First, you import the `mysql.connector` module to use its functionalities.\n",
    "2. Then, you establish a connection to your MySQL database by providing the required connection details such as the host, username, password, and database name.\n",
    "3. Next, you create a cursor object using the `cursor()` method. The cursor object allows you to execute SQL queries and fetch the results.\n",
    "4. You define an SQL query and execute it using the `execute()` method of the cursor. In this example, the query selects all records from the \"Customers\" table.\n",
    "5. After executing the query, you use the `fetchall()` method to retrieve all the results returned by the query.\n",
    "6. Finally, you iterate over the result set and print each row of data.\n",
    "7. Once you have finished working with the cursor and connection, it's important to close them using the `close()` method to release any resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `cursor()` method creates a cursor object that enables you to execute SQL queries and retrieve results from the database. It acts as a handle or pointer to the result set returned by the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `execute()` method is used to execute an SQL query. It takes the query string as a parameter and sends it to the database for execution. You can also pass parameters to the `execute()` method to bind values dynamically to your query.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using the cursor and execute methods, you can interact with the MySQL database from Python and perform various operations such as querying, inserting, updating, or deleting data."

    "5. SELECT: The SELECT clause specifies the columns to be included in the result set. It retrieves the selected columns from the table(s) based on the previous clauses' results.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. DISTINCT: The DISTINCT keyword eliminates duplicate rows from the result set. It ensures that only unique rows are included in the final output.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. ORDER BY: The ORDER BY clause sorts the result set based on one or more columns. It arranges the rows in ascending or descending order according to the specified criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. LIMIT/OFFSET: The LIMIT and OFFSET clauses limit the number of rows returned by the query and specify the starting position for retrieving rows, respectively. These clauses are commonly used for pagination or restricting the result set.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that not all clauses are mandatory in every SQL query. The clauses' order can vary depending on the specific query requirements, and some clauses may be omitted if not applicable.\n",
